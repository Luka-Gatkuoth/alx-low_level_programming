This is a 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings project, where the following tasks are accomplished
0. Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.
1. Write a function that copies memory area.
2. Write a function that locates a character in a string.
3. Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
4. Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
5. Write a function that locates a substring.

Prototype: char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle);
The _strstr() function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack. The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared
Returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.
6. Write a function that prints the chessboard.

Prototype: void print_chessboard(char (*a)[8]);
7. Write a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
8. Write a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.

Prototype: void set_string(char **s, char *to);
9. Create a file that contains the password for the crackme2 executable.
